== Installation

1. clone the repository

2. Change directory to 'blogoloo' and run:
       cp config/database.yml.dist config/database.yml
       bundle
       rake db:create
       rake db:migrate
       rake db:seed

== Adding admin users

Atm there's no admin interface for managing users. Just open a console with 'rails c' and add a user manually:

  User.create(email: "your@email.com", password: "yoursecret")

== Administration Interface

Link: http://localhost:3000/admin

== Google Sitemap

We use the gem site,ap_generator (https://github.com/kjvarga/sitemap_generator) to easily create sitemaps. To update the sitemap on server, run:

  rake sitemap:refresh:no_ping

Don't forget to adjust the full url to your sitemaps in robots.txt

== Customization

=== Modify custom hero images

You can add, remove or change the +HERO_IMAGES+ variable inside the <tt>app/models/article.rb</tt> model.
